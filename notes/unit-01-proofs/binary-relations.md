# Binary Relations

A ==binary relation== is a mathematical object that maps elements from one set, called the ==domain==, to another set, called the ==codomain==.

Now, let's look at the definition of a function:

> ==Functions== are mappings that assign elements from one set (_domain_) to another (_codomain_). 

The distinction is that in a function, every element should only map to at most one element, so, for example, an element $a$ in domain $A$ can only be mapped to $b$ in codomain $B$, not both $b$, and $c$, etc.

So, _a function is a special case of a binary relation_.

A function that maps elements in domain $A$ to elements in codomain $B$ is denoted as $f : A \rightarrow B$.

If a function is a ==_partial function_==, some elements in the domain can be undefined (some elements in the domain don't have an arrow coming out). For example, $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$ does not assign a value to $0$. 
On the other hand, if every element in the domain is defined, it is called a ==_total function_==.

Function ==_composition_== is as simple as taking the value of one function, and passing it to another one:

$$(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$$

A binary relation $R$ has a set $A$, _domain_ of $R$; a set $B$, _codomain_ of $R$; and a subset of $A \times B$, the _graph_ of $R$ (this is the relation part — arrows from $A$ to $B$).

The notation is similar to functions: $R : A \rightarrow B$. This is a relation "between $A$ and $B$" (or, "from $A$ to $B$").
If the domain and codomain are the same set $A$, we can say that the relation is "on $A$". 

When a pair $(a, \ b)$ is in the graph of $R$, it is denoted as $a \ R \ b$.

The _image_ of a set $X$, under a relation $R$, is written as $R(X)$. It is the codomain set.

For example, look at this diagram:

![An example of binary relation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Injection_keine_Injektion_2a.svg/200px-Injection_keine_Injektion_2a.svg.png)

$X$ is the domain, $Y$ is the codomain, graph of $R$ is $\{(1, D), \ (2, C), \ (3, C)\}$

==_Range_== is the actual elements with arrows coming in. In this example, while $Y$ is the codomain, $\{D, \ C\}$ is the range.
So, the range is not always equal to codomain — it can be equal to, or smaller than the codomain.

The set of points with an arrow coming in from $X$ is the $R(X)$, the image of $X$.

We can write it in logical notation as such:
$$R(X) = \{b \in Y \ | \ \exists a \in X \ a R b\}$$

$Y$ is the codomain set, and $b$ is an element in it; $X$ is the domain set, and $a$ is an element in it.

So, the formula above says that $R(X)$ is the set of $b$ in $Y$ such that there exists an $a$ in $X$ such that $(a, \ b)$ is a pair that's in the graph of $R$ (remember that's what $a R b$ means).

This part itself $[\exists a \in X \ a R b]$ indicates that there is an arrow to $b$ coming from the set of $X$.

The ==_inverse_== of a relation $R : A \rightarrow B$ is denoted as $R^{-1}$, and it is the relation from $B$ to $A$. It just flips the arrows around, so the codomain becomes the domain, and the domain becomes the codomain.
$R^{-1}(x)$ called the _inverse image_ of $x$ under $R$.

This formula holds true: $aRb \iff bR^{-1}a$
An arrow coming from $a$ ends in $b$, and vice versa, an arrow that ends in $b$ is coming from $a$.

Now, there are some terms that we are going to take a look at:
- ==total relation==: there is at least one arrow out of every domain element. (in a relation from $A$ to $B$, every element in set $A$ has to have an arrow going out)
    - $R$ is total iff $A = R^{-1}(B)$.
    - If a relation is both total and a function, that means there is exactly one arrow coming out of every domain element.
- ==surjective relation==: there is at least one arrow into every codomain element (the range is the entire codomain).
    - $R$ is surjective iff $R(A) = B$ 
    - $|A| \geq |B| \ (\text{for finite } A, \ B)$ 
    - Example of a _non-injective surjective_ function:

- ==injective relation==: there is at most one arrow into every codomain element.
    - $|A| \leq |B| \ (\text{for finite } A, \ B)$ 
    - Example of an _injective non-surjective_ function:

- ==bijective relation==: there is exactly one arrow out in every domain element, and exactly one arrow in every codomain element (one-to-one correspondence).
    - $|A| = |B| \ (\text{for finite } A, \ B)$
    - Example of a _bijection_ (_injective surjective_ function):

Here is a nice way to keep these in mind: think of _totality_, _surjection_, _function_, and _injection_ as superheroes who are responsible for inspecting the arrows from one set to another.

_Totality_ is concerned with the domain, _surjection_ is concerned with the codomain. Both of them want _at least_ one arrow.

_Function_ is concerned with the domain, _injection_ is concerned with the codomain. Both of them want _at most_ one arrow.

_Bijection_ always wants one-to-one correspondence.
