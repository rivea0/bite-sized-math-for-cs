# State Machines — Invariants

State machines are abstract models of step-by-step processes.

We can think of a state machine as a binary relation on a set.
In this case, the elements will be called _states_, the relation will be called _transition relation_ or _state graph_, and an arrow in the graph will be called a _transition_.
A transition from state $q$ to state $r$ is written as $q \longrightarrow r$.
State machines also have a specific _start state_.

An example below is one that counts from 0 to 99 and overflows at 100. Not very useful.

State machines that have at most one transition out of each state is called _deterministic_. One example is the one above that counts from 1 to 99, and overflows after that. The only transition is from $n$ to $n + 1$.

_Note: The general model of a state machine is also about responding to the inputs given, but we are not looking at this for simplicity's sake._

When we used induction the last time, we were showing that a property holds in every step of the process.
A property that is preserved through the whole process is called the ==preserved invariant==.

The _invariant principle_ says that:
> If a preserved invariant of a state machine is true for the start state, then it is true for all reachable states.

A reachable state is a state that appears in some execution.
And, what is execution?
It's a sequence of states with the property that:
a) it begins with the start state
b) if $q$ and $r$ are consecutive states, then $q \longrightarrow r$

Realize that the invariant principle is just induction, applied to state machines.

There is a technique called _fast exponentiation_. Take a look at this code:

```python
base = int(input('Enter base: '))
exp = int(input('Enter exponent: '))

def fast_exp(x, y, z):
    if z < 0: return 'Nonnegative integers only!'
    if z == 0: return y
    if z % 2 == 0:
        return fast_exp(x ** 2, y, z // 2)
    if z % 2 == 1: 
        return fast_exp(x ** 2, x * y, z // 2)

print(fast_exp(base, 1, exp))

```

Notice that we assume `z` (the exponent) to be an integer as we use integer division (`z // 2`) like so.

Here, our start state is `(base, 1, exp)`.

Transitions will be according to this rule:

$$(x, \ y, \ z) \longrightarrow
\begin{cases}
(x^2, \ y, \ \text{quotient}(z, \ 2)) & \text{if } z \text{ is nonzero and even}\\
(x^2, \ xy, \ \text{quotient}(z, \ 2)) & \text{if  } z \text{ is nonzero and odd}
\end{cases}
$$

And, our preserved invariant is that $z$ is a nonnegative integer, and $yx^z = \text{base}^{\text{exp}}$.

One way to verify $yx^z = \text{base}^{\text{exp}}$ is to see if the transitioned state is what we think it is.

Since we're only looking at the case when $z$ is odd, we can use $(z - 1) / 2$ to do the "integer division," and steer clear of a remainder.

In this transition, $y$ becomes $xy$, $x$ becomes $x^2$, and $z$ becomes $(z - 1) / 2$.

In order to write $yx^z$, we have to write $(xy)(x^2)^{(z - 1) / 2}$.

Doing a little simplifying, we get $(xy)x^{z - 1}$, and further simplifying we get $yx^z$ which is indeed what we assumed to be $\text{base}^{\text{exp}}$!
So, the new values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ satisfy the invariant.

To verify a program, there are two properties to look at: _partial correctness_ and _termination_.

In the fast exponential example, we've proved the correctness, so let's see if we can figure out if it terminates.

One thing to notice is that at each transition, $z$ becomes $\text{quotient}(z, \ 2)$, so it gets smaller. Since it is a nonnegative integer, there is a point where it can't get any smaller, in fact, it can't get smaller more than $log_2(\text{exp})$ times, by then it'd already hit $0$. So, it indeed terminates.

A ==derived variable== is a function assigning a "value" to each state.

So, take a derived variable $v$: 
$$v : \text{States} \rightarrow \text{Values}$$

If the values are natural numbers, it can be said that "$v$ is $\mathbb{N}$ valued".
