# Prerequisites & Resources

Recommended prerequisites for the course are noted as 

> familiarity with sequences and series, limits, and differentiation and integration of functions of one variable are necessary. This is taught in [18.01 Single Variable Calculus (OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010).


### For starters
- [Stanford's Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking) given by Dr. Keith Devlin is a good starting point.
- [How to Read Mathematics](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/490/handouts/math-read.html) by Shai Simonson and Fernando Gouvea is a nice document about how reading mathematics differs from other kinds of reading.
- Additionally, I would encourage you to read [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) by Paul Lockhart, which was pretty influential to me on deciding not to be intimidated of the topic.

### Background
- If you're coming from a humanities background, [Six Septembers: Mathematics for the Humanist](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/zeabook/55/) is a delicious book, and it's free.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math) is greatly structured and provides math education for all levels.
- [Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorLeonard) 's videos are also very helpful, especially his Calculus playlists.
- [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/subjects/math) has free textbooks, from pre-algebra to calculus and many more.
- [Book of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/) by Richard Hammack is a free book on introduction to proofs.


### More on Discrete Math
- Kimberly Brehm's [Discrete Math I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3Ffwsnad0k&list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz) and [Discrete Math II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spEjNcd37IQ&list=PLl-gb0E4MII0sGLCJeqDB3y63HZ6lM5LJ) are very helpful.
- [Discrete Mathematics with Applications](https://ia802302.us.archive.org/15/items/2-discrete-mathematics-with-applications-by-susanna-s.-epp-4th-edition/2Discrete%20Mathematics%20with%20Applications%20by%20Susanna%20S.%20Epp%20-%204th%20Edition.pdf) by Susanna S. Epp is a great textbook.


### Logic
- [Logic Matters](https://www.logicmatters.net/) is an invaluable resource. Especially check out [An Introduction to Formal Logic](https://www.logicmatters.net/ifl/) and [Teach Yourself Logic study guide](https://www.logicmatters.net/tyl/).
- The [Open Logic Project](https://openlogicproject.org/) has great [resources](https://builds.openlogicproject.org/), all open-source.
- [Sets, Logic and Maths for Computing](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-42218-9) is another introductory textbook. 


### Miscellaneous
- [Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com/) has beautiful articles on various topics.
- [The Math Book](https://mitpressbookstore.mit.edu/book/9780744079371) from DK's Big Ideas Series is a fun guide.
- Since this is a course for, eventually, _computer science_, [basecs series](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi/basecs-series) by Vaidehi Joshi is very fun, and explores topics that some of the sections introduce. It also has a podcast.
